## Boilerplate

Uses the [react-redux-starter-kit](https://github.com/rackt/react-router) for the starting boilerplate.  See the kit's [readme](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit/blob/master/README.md) for explanation of the [fractal](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit/wiki/Fractal-Project-Structure) project structure.

## Express for Initial Development

Currently using Express as a server, convert to a Java SpringBoot server is likely a good idea.

## Run It

```bash
$ npm install                   # Install project dependencies
$ npm start                     # Compile and launch
```
If everything works, you should have a server running at http://localhost:3000
